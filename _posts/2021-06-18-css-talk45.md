title: "Boel Nelson's PhD Defense: Differential Privacy — A Balancing Act"

teaser: |-
  Data privacy is an ever important aspect of data
  analyses. Historically, a plethora of privacy techniques have been
  introduced to protect data, but few have stood the test of
  time. From investigating the overlap between big data research, and
  security and privacy research, I have found that _differential
  privacy_ presents itself as a promising defender of data privacy.
  
  Differential privacy is a rigorous, mathematical notion of
  privacy. Nevertheless, privacy comes at a cost. In order to achieve
  differential privacy, we need to introduce some form of inaccuracy
  (i.e. error) to our analyses. Hence, practitioners need to engage in
  a _balancing act_ between accuracy and privacy when adopting
  differential privacy. As a consequence, understanding this
  accuracy/privacy trade-off is vital to being able to use
  differential privacy in real data analyses.
  
  In this thesis, I aim to bridge the gap between differential privacy
  in theory, and differential privacy in practice. Most notably, I aim
  to convey a better understanding of the accuracy/privacy trade-off,
  by 1) implementing tools to tweak accuracy/privacy in a real use
  case, 2) presenting a methodology for empirically predicting error,
  and 3) systematizing and analyzing known accuracy improvement
  techniques for differentially private algorithms. Additionally, I
  also put differential privacy into context by investigating how it
  can be applied in the automotive domain. Using the automotive domain
  as an example, I introduce the main challenges that constitutes the
  balancing act, and provide advice for moving forward.
